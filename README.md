# JavaBasicConcepts

### What is java?
> Java is a high-level programming language originally developed by Sun Microsystems and released in 1995. Java runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX.

### List the features of Java Programming Language

#### Advantages

Feature | Description
------- | -----------
Object Oriented | In Java, everything is an Object. Java can be easily extended since it is based on the Object model.
Platform Independent | Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++, when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather into platform independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on.
Simple | Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the basic concept of OOP Java, it would be easy to master.
Secure | With Java's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems. Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.
Architecture-neutral | Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format, which makes the compiled code executable on many processors, with the presence of Java runtime system.
Portable | Being architecture-neutral and having no implementation dependent aspects of the specification makes Java portable. Compiler in Java is written in ANSI C with a clean portability boundary, which is a POSIX subset.
Robust | Java makes an effort to eliminate error prone situations by emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking.

#### Applications
> ___**Write Once, Run Anywhere.**___

|||
-|-
Multithreaded | With Java's multithreaded feature it is possible to write programs that can perform many tasks simultaneously. This design feature allows the developers to construct interactive applications that can run smoothly.
Interpreted | Java byte code is translated on the fly to native machine instructions and is not stored anywhere. The development process is more rapid and analytical since the linking is an incremental and light-weight process.
High Performance | With the use of Just-In-Time compilers, Java enables high performance.
Distributed | Java is designed for the distributed environment of the internet.
Dynamic | Java is considered to be more dynamic than C or C++ since it is designed to adapt to an evolving environment. Java programs can carry extensive amount of run-time information that can be used to verify and resolve accesses to objects on run-time.

### JVM, JRE, JDK
### Basic syntax (Object, class, methods, and instance variables)

|||
-|-
Object | Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behavior such as wagging their tail, barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class.
Class | A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behavior/state that the object of its type supports.
Methods | A method is basically a behavior. A class can contain many methods. It is in methods where the logics are written, data is manipulated and all the actions are executed.
Instance Variables | Each object has its unique set of instance variables. An object's state is created by the values assigned to these instance variables.

### Java Modifiers
